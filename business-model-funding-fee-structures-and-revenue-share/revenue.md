# Revenue



G360DAOâ€™s primary business is generating revenue from monthly subscriptions on information security insight applications.&#x20;

Guardian360 B.V. will be the first client of the DAO and will pay in euros for the use of information security insight applications.&#x20;

Payment in stablecoins will be offered as an alternative option.&#x20;

Most of the world still uses traditional payment systems, so payment gateways for credit card payments will need to be supported.

### Direct sales

G360DAO will develop a webshop for customers to buy one-time services and/or subscriptions on services. By doing it this way, G360DAO will have multiple revenue streams and won't be dependent on just one revenue stream.

### On demand development

Because the council selects information security insights to be developed, not everyone will be satisfied. It might occur that certain features, which are very important to some, will not be selected for a vote by the community.

To ensure that the features can still be developed we will facilitate people to sponsor the development of specific information security insights.&#x20;

We will follow the normal process to determine what the development weight and value of the feature is, as well as who gets to develop it. The fee will be transferred by the sponsor to the treasury of the DAO, so that the developer can be paid for the development.

The feature will be made available as open source. In addition, it can also be included in the Guardian360 Lighthouse platform and direct sales model, so this feature will also generate recurring revenue.
