# Investment token sale

G360DAO will eventually mint a maximum of 100,000,000 investment tokens. As founder of G360DAO, Guardian360 B.V. will receive 10,000,000 of the investment tokens at no cost.&#x20;

These investment tokens are bound to the Guardian360 B.V. bucket and are not eligible for rev share as long as Guardian360 B.V. receives a fixed percentage rev share.

The rest of the tokens will be offered via a private sale which is an early-stage investment round for strategic investors with a considerable amount of investible funds.&#x20;

Holders of investment tokens are entitled to receive revenue share and will be able to vote on proposals. Therefore, not all tokens will be sold right away, but only 5,000,000 will be sold initially.&#x20;

The remaining 85,000,000 will be sold when G360DAO needs additional funds. The council will allow the community to vote on this proposal.
