# Business Model, Funding, Fee Structures and Revenue Share

The business model of G360DAO is based on various components. The income of the DAO comes from various sources:

1. **Investments** – Both through traditional investments and an NFT sale
2. **Continuous revenue streams** – Based on direct sales (one-off and monthly subscriptions fee) for the usage of the products of G360DAO.

The cost side is predominantly related to direct and indirect work on the DAO and its security insights. The costs will consist of 2 main streams:

1. Direct costs for payments of work performed
2. Indirect costs as result of revenue sharing with the Investors and RevShare tokenholders (details in [Appendix Financials](https://app.gitbook.com/o/2YkrRUxPFdNDfr8LQAiG/s/QZ3ahML7tpbcBqNJehsq/)).
