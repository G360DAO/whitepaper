# Revenue Sharing

Ultimately, revenue will be shared amongst participants as follows:

| DRevShare token holders      | 20% - 25%\*\* |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Other RevShare token holders | 10%           |
| Investors                    | 20% - 25%\*\* |
| Guardian360 B.V.             | 0 - 20%\*     |
| G360DAO Treasury             | 20% - 40%\*   |
| NFT holders                  |  max 10%\*\*  |
| Rest of community            | 0%            |
| Total                        | 100%          |

&#x20;\* As long as Guardian360 B.V. is the only client of the DAO their rev share % will go directly to the treasury and the treasury will have a 40% revenue share at the start of the DAO.

\*\* Because NFT token holders are entitled to a capped amount of rev share, no more rev share will be granted to NFT holders once all NFT holders have received the agreed amount. Once the maximum amount has been paid to the NFT holders, the revenues generated thereafter will be distributed equally among the DRevShare and Investor token holders.

The revenue share for DRevShare token holders is equal to the Investors’ share, because we value the contribution of developers as much as the Investors’ contribution.

The money in the G360 Treasury will be assigned to the specific circles in yearly budgets by the G360DAO community through a strategic vote.

Initial contributors, such as Guardian360 B.V. shareholders, Guardian360 B.V. management, Guardian360 B.V. employees and venture capital investments might benefit from the G360DAO token value as well. They would be allocated a percentage of the total G360 token supply before the token is released during a token generation event.
