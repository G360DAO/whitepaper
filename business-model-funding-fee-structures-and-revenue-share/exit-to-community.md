# Exit  to community

Guardian360 B.V. aims to gradually hand over all technical intellectual property to G360DAO in order to increase speed of development and allow G360DAO to develop what the market really needs.&#x20;

However, due to contractual obligations to partners, clients, and shareholders we canâ€™t do this right away and all at once.&#x20;

Once the G360DAO community has reached consensus on the technical requirements of information security insights, Guardian360 B.V. will transfer some intellectual property and the relevant knowledge to G360DAO. This will facilitate hackers, security engineers and developers to quickly develop information security insights and generate revenue via G360DAO.

Eventually, the shareholders of Guardian360 B.V. aim to sell their shares to G360DAO, resulting in all intellectual property, revenue and costs belonging to the DAO. How and when needs to be determined because G360DAO must first become an established and well-functioning organisation. Also, there are a lot of legal and tax aspects to this exit.
