# A Revolution in Digital Security

G360DAO is an innovative and game changing initiative that enables new ways of venturing, equal distribution of revenues and solving real world information security problems.&#x20;

It revolves around an autonomous organisation where all investors, participants, developers, and security researchers can vote which problems to solve first – and decide democratically what the solution is valued at.

For investors this is an opportunity to grow their capital in a sustainable way while contributing to a new form of venturing: the DAO.&#x20;

For security researchers the DAO enables world-wide cooperation with the brightest minds to solve information security and privacy challenges much faster than before and with a fair compensation for their work.&#x20;

For enthusiasts the NFT’s will have real and emotional value. Value that will grow over time when the G360DAO evolves, serving the community and investors alike.

G360DAO is built on the [Guardian360](https://www.guardian360.net) legacy and is a real organisation – albeit distributed globally. It has real customers, actual revenue and a working software platform that has proven its value since 2015.&#x20;

The time has come to evolve to the next level in distributed development and decentralised autonomy based on Web3 technology, while solving actual IT security and privacy issues.&#x20;

For the people, by the people.
