### Comparison to other initiatives

G360DAO intends to develop better solutions compared to what is available in the market currently. In the table below we will compare Guardian360 to the third-party initiatives as mentioned below.

To gain a better understanding of the various columns in the table, the following is a short description of what these terms entail:

* **Open-Source**; is an Open-Source community solution available for the vendor's products?
* Pricing; is an **affordable** (for individuals, small businesses) commercial solution available?
* Insight; does the product offer **full security insight** or is it only one of the many blocks required for this insight?
* Results; does the solution provide results **that are easily interpretable by non-technical security personnel** (clear instructions on what to do and focus on only what is important)?
* Privacy; does the tooling offer insights from a **technical privacy perspective** instead of only a security perspective?
* Compliance; are insights matched against an **industry compliance standard** such ISO27001?
* Assets; does the solution provide **full discovery and inventory** of all available assets or does it only provide partial insight such as vulnerabilities?
