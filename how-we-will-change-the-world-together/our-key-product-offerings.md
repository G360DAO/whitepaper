# Our Key Product Offerings

G360 DAO will focus on the development of the following key products:

1. Open Source security insight component for web 2, including:
   1. Scanners for vulnerabilities in networks, websites/web applications, IoT devices and other Internet connected hard- and software.
   2. Recommendations to better comply with and deviate from norms, standards, laws, and regulations.
   3. Report incorrectly implemented or missing hardening best practices
   4. Detect intruders
   5. Recommendations to prevent ransomware &#x20;
2. Smart contract â€“ web3 security scanners. Decentralised solutions and applications are rising quickly, creating an even larger DeFi, MetaVerse and other Web3 solution communities. Much of web3 is based on blockchain and smart contracts, which post new security problems in their own where new and innovative security solutions need to be found.

G360DAO participants will develop information security insight applications that will be open sourced for non-commercial use (Please refer to [Licensing](https://github.com/G360DAO/information-security-insights/blob/main/LICENSE.md)). Each information security insight application can be operated from a command line.

A long list of information security insights can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/G360DAO).
