# What We Stand For

We are a collective of visionary individuals that are here to disrupt the security industry by pushing security solutions forward using decentralised autonomy and Web3 technology.&#x20;

We believe in empowering the security community, giving full control over decisions of where security is evolving.&#x20;

By leveraging the knowledge and experience of the community, we aim to provide insights and solve structural real world security problems.

Our core values are:

·      Honesty and full transparency for all involved

·      Highest standards in all aspects

·      Curiosity and interest in other people and technology

Instead of having traditional centralised companies, **we aim to incentivise the hard work of the security community to be rewarded fairly based on quality contributions**.&#x20;

We believe in a Web3 world, where _**any**_** participation does not need permission, is decentralised and incentivised**.&#x20;

We _do not_ value you based on where you were born or live, ethical background, religion, skin colour or sexual orientation.&#x20;

**We value you for your skills and how this can service the community going forward.** This is how you will be rewarded. Everyone will be treated equally, there is no traditional hierarchy.

The DAO community will consist of rebels, creators, thinkers and doers with the same goal and vision: to build the best possible security solutions in order to make the world a more secure and fair place.

Each contribution will be submitted for careful review and will get voted for in the community, which in succession will result in token rewards for the contributor. If these goals, visions, and community are something you would like to be part of, we enthusiastically ask you to join us now!
