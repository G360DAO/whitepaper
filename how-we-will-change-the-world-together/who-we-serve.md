# Who We Serve

G360DAO will serve three types of customers:

1. Hackers, developers and other experts that will use open source code for free
2. Software firms and integrators that will obtain a license for source code they embed in their own products and service offering
3. Clients who are capable to use G360DAO information security insights themselves

### Hackers, developers and other experts

G360DAO information security insight applications can be used free of charge as long as the [license criteria](https://github.com/Guardian360DAO/information-security-insights/blob/main/LICENSE.md) are met. However, we expect some hackers, developers, and other experts to obtain a paid license because they need a commercial license for their activities.

### Software firms and integrators

IT services providers and managed services providers are already using tools to monitor client IT environments. Information security insight applications developed by G360DAO will be integrated by these organisations to allow them to have all relevant data in one application.

[Guardian360 B.V.](https://www.guardian360.net), a Dutch leading information security software firm, will be the launching customer for G360DAO and will integrate information security insight applications in its Lighthouse platform. Guardian360 B.V. sells its Services via Distributors and Partners to Clients generating monthly recurring revenue streams in various countries. A portion of that monthly revenue will be used to purchase from G360DAO.

Clients who are capable to use G360DAO information security insights themselves\
Not every organisation outsources its IT-management. Therefore, G360DAO will create a webshop to allow these clients to obtain paid licenses.
