# Main Actors and Team

G360DAO's eclectic mix of contributors are organised into different circles based on the type of contribution they make to the product and the organisation. Some will be active on a daily basis, while some can have a more passive role. Despite the variety of players and their levels of contribution, all of our members will be able to participate on various levels in the governance of G360DAO (see [Governance & Tokenomics](broken-reference)).

While we are starting with a smaller centralised core team, we are driven to let go of the reigns as soon as practically possible in order to release the operational activities of the DAO to our community.  Contributors will have influence to drive decisions and operations within the circle in which they operate.&#x20;

One of the key circles will be the “developers circle”. This group will be open to anyone who wants to actively work on the primary processes and products of G360DAO. Within this circle, the participant can earn voting rights based on reputation which will be represented by the respective RevShare tokens (see Incentives). For other competencies and functions, different circles will be set up, e.g. legal, marketing, etc.

Other actors involved in G360DAO will be:

1. Guardian360 B.V. as the initiator of G360DAO
2. The investors, all who want to invest without performing further operational tasks
3. The other contributing circles (other than Dev), all groups performing operational tasks in various disciplines and
4. An open community, being anyone who does not invest nor performs operational or managerial tasks in the DAO, but is interested in following or actively be involved in discussion within the G360DAO through their discord channel.

There are 2 groups that consist of delegated persons from various other actor groups. These will play a more overarching daily operational role within G360DAO (as shown in the image above):

1. The G360DAO Council - will be formed by representatives of Guardian360 B.V., the Dev Circle and the other circles of which at least 1 person from the Legal Circle. The first council will be appointed by the founders. Future council members can be chosen by the G360DAO participants. The council is responsible for various daily overarching tasks and shall consist of no more than7 persons. One of the most important tasks of the council is to submit proposals for strategic and general financial decisions (although anyone in the community is allowed to send in decision proposals), and initial selection and classification of incoming voting proposals (see Decision Layer and Types).
2. Quality Control Group. (See overview picture) - The Quality Control group will have representatives from the Dev Circle and Security Engineers and will assess the quality of developed software before final payment is approved for work performed by the developers.

Within the G360DAO, we aim for the right balance between _decentralising_ what you can and _centralising_ what you must.&#x20;

For compliance and operational reasons, a centralised council will need to be set up as a gatekeeper to ensure that the G360DAO will not run into tax or compliance complications.&#x20;

While governance actions can be set in motion when deemed necessary by the council, in order to guarantee decentralisation, most of the decisions are made decentralised and the council is a delegated council.&#x20;

This ensures that council members can be replaced as the community deems necessary.&#x20;

The only exception is that, due to geographical tax restrictions (depending on the final legal form and jurisdiction in which G360DAO will operate) a minimum of 1 council member should be a resident of the Netherlands.
