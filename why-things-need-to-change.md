# Why Things Need to Change

For nearly 50 years, hackers and other information security professionals have been working to find and fix vulnerabilities and other entry points for cyber criminals.&#x20;

While information security has been getting more attention over the past 10 years, the resilience of organisations against cyber-attacks has not improved, but instead, it has become degraded and more chaotic.&#x20;

* The number of vulnerabilities found in hardware and software increases every year.&#x20;
* Criminals have become better organised and their targets are increasingly becoming victims of ransomware, theft of intellectual property and/or other cybercrime related activities. The financial damage is now estimated at billions of dollars annually.&#x20;
* The importance of personal and intellectual privacy is growing exponentially, yet since many companies do not have sufficient information security systems and processes in place, privacy is not always guaranteed.&#x20;
* Web3 presents a lot of opportunities, but unfortunately, we already notice abuse by opportunistic cyber criminals.

The main reasons for this degradation and insufficiency is:

1. **There is too much noise**. There are way too many information security problems to be solved by corporate organisations, also because they tend to focus more on shareholder value, resulting in inadequate information security solutions, insufficient collaboration and information not being disclosed to all parties affected. Organisations are forced to use a multitude of products without the assurance they are protected sufficiently.
2. **Rewards, ownership, and governance are not distributed fairly.** Hackers and open-source software developers are not fairly rewarded for their efforts, which forces them to have additional sources of income, which leads to reduced motivation, focus, and poorly maintained products.&#x20;
3. **Talent resources are not harnessed effectively.** The information security industry proclaims a lack of talent available while a lot of talent is wasted. Not everybody is able to participate due to immigration laws, tax regulations, and geographical relocation liabilities. The result is a loss of brilliant ideas and productivity.
