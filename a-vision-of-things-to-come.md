# A Vision of Things to Come

Information security needs to be overhauled and modernised.&#x20;

As long as the current status quo continues to be rehashed, this sector will never be able to produce meaningful and lasting solutions that will stem the tide of nefarious actors who hold the world at ransom.&#x20;

We strongly believe that increasing justice on the digital infrastructure can only be achieved by uniting hackers, developers, security engineers and customers all over the world in a rebellious manner.&#x20;

It is through this synergy that we can create and develop real information security solutions that strengthen resilience of organisations, thus preventing them from getting compromised by cyber-criminals.&#x20;

A holistic view on information security, risk management, privacy as well as web2, web3 and IOT is necessary to be able to create solutions that cover all aspects, instead of a few of them.&#x20;

Ownership, decision-making power, and distribution of wealth must be distributed fairly amongst the participants to empower them to reap the fruits of their labor.

This is our revolution.
