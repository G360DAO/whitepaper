# Incentives

The incentives for participants for playing an active role in the G360DAO are multifold and designed around short term and long term incentives through the payment, RevShare and investment token construction.

**Short term** **incentives** are arranged through direct payout of grants and fees. Per task that needs to be taken up within the DAO, the decision structure can set up a direct payment fee, in the form a **payment token** (e.g. USDC).&#x20;

These will be paid out immediately once the task has been completed. E.g. for building a certain information security insight application, an amount is reserved for the programmer who performs the specific task.&#x20;

Once the task has been completed and approved by the quality assurance group, the agreed amount is paid out.&#x20;

The exact amount to be paid for the task will be decided on by a strategic vote and will be an estimated average (at time of writing) of EUR 10.000,00.

**Long term incentives** for participants of the DAO are arranged through the rev share and investment token structure. These token holders get passive income through a percentage of the revenue of the DAO.

**RevShare Tokens**

If a participant takes on work, they are eligible to get compensated in direct fees as described above, but they will also be compensated in RevShare tokens.&#x20;

These tokens, as stated earlier, serve as reputation and voting rights but also grant the participant the right to a percentage of the revenue over a period of time, ensuring long term commitment.&#x20;

This percentage is based on the relative share of the combined RevShare tokens in the G360DAO. E.g., if a participant has 3 development RevShare tokens and all RevShare tokens (marketing, development, legal, etc.) combined add up to 100, this participant is entitled to 3% of the revenue that is allocated for all RevShare token holders.

Again, these tokens are non-transferable, meaning they cannot be sold to anyone including to G360DAO. These tokens also depreciate in a linear way over time.&#x20;

This means that if a participant has e.g., 3 RevShare tokens, and the depreciation period is three years, by the end of year three the participant doesn't own any RevShare tokens anymore.  If they didnâ€™t earn new RevShare tokens for any additional work or maintenance on code, the value after three years will be zero.

**Investment tokens**

Investment tokens are not earned but can be bought and sold by investors. These tokens also grant certain voting rights as described earlier and entitle the holders to a percentage of the revenue (one of the other buckets to which the revenue is distributed). These tokens don't depreciate over time, meaning that if the investor bought X amount of investment tokens they will keep this exact amount unless of course they sell or buy tokens.
