# Token structure

In the G360DAO we distinguish various tokens that are used in the DAO. An overview is shown below.

&#x20;The first token type is a **payment token** that will be used to pay for any work that is done in the DAO. This will most probably be one of the main stablecoins like USDC. This token does not have any voting rights or revenue sharing rights.

\----

The second token type are the **RevShare tokens**. There will be specific RevShare tokens per circle. Per circle, these RevShare tokens can only be earned by performing work and cannot be bought or traded. Therefore, they also represent reputation in the specific circle of G360DAO. Based on the amount of RevShare tokens, one has a higher or lower voting power within in their circle and or bucket.

Besides voting power, RevShare tokens also give right to Revenue Sharing. A percentage of the incoming revenue will be shared amongst all RevShare token holders of G360DAO. RevShare tokens are depreciated over time in a linear way, of which an example is shown below (please also refer to Incentives).

An example of a RevShare token is the DRevShare token for Developers in the Development circle or LRevShare tokens for the Legal circle.

The third token type is the **investment token**. These tokens can be bought and traded and represent voting- and revenue sharing rights.&#x20;

A fixed percentage of the revenue is shared with the investment token holders.&#x20;

Voting rights with investment tokens come in series and voting will be capped, regardless of the amount invested, e.g. 0 to 100 investment tokens represent 1 vote, 101 to 1000 2 votes and 1000+ 3 votes in the investment bucket. This prevents a single investment token holder buying too much voting power in their bucket.
