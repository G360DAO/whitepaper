# Accountability and decision making

Good governance has the right balance on 3 crucial elements:

1. Clear accountability
2. Proper decision-making processes
3. A good incentive structure to participate in governance

G360DAO has multi-layer governance model to ensure decentralised decision making as much as possible, without losing:&#x20;

* the possibility to act swiftly as possible when needed
* prevent "no decision" lock in and&#x20;
* to assure that actions and decisions can be judged on critical elements like regulatory compliance.

Therefore, a combination of operational and strategic decision-making processes are designed and combined with a multi-layer bucket and operational circle voting system.

1. The highest decision layer is for **strategic votes** (general and development decisions). This layer has multiple actor groups that can vote on decisions through our unique Bucket Decision Model, which will be explained in more detail in the next section.
2. The second layer is the **operational** **daily decisions** that are made within the different circles. \
   \
   Circles have a high degree of autonomy for their specific tasks and decisions. Voting is done through the various tokens that are valid for that specific circle. \
   \
   Depending on the group, these tokens can be bought or earned, representing a share-like or reputation-based system. \
   \
   This setup is designed in such a way that a person holding tokens in one group cannot vote in other groups with these tokens. \
   \
   They can however use these tokens to vote on higher decisions in a higher layer.&#x20;

**Strategic voting** is only valid in the highest layer of decision making. A vote is only classified as strategic in the case of (periodical) budget revision decisions, decisions relating to the goal of the organisation or concerning the appointment of council members.

Strategic votes require a higher quorum and approval rate than operational votes. This means that in order for a strategic vote to pass it is required to have at least 66% of total eligible votes to vote in favour. E.g., if there are 100 votes in the DAO, at least 66% of the votes should have voted, and of that amount of votes, 66% should have voted in favour of the proposal.&#x20;

If the quorum is not met, the vote will be up for voting again, but through the operational vote mechanism. This is to prevent that certain decisions will never be able to be made.

In **operational voting**, no quorum is needed. Besides that, the votes in favour have to be a simple relative majority, meaning that at least 50% + 1 votes have to be in favour of the proposal in order to pass. Operational voting is the default in the lower layer, and for non-strategic decisions in the higher decision layer.

&#x20;**Anyone in the DAO can propose a voting** on the higher decision layer, but before a proposal is submitted to the collective for voting, **the council will classify the proposal as either strategic or operational and have the authority to reject the proposal as inadmissible.** Rejection is only possible on the grounds of legal, regulatory and/or compliance issues, potential endangerment of business continuity, severe impact on the reputation of the DAO or violation of internal policies.
