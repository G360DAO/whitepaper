# Key Components

While the DAO consist of various elements and functions, from a technical and functional perspective, there are two key components are the driving force on how the DAO operates. These are:

* the transfer of value in tokens (rev share, investment or payment tokens)&#x20;
* and the notary function - keeping track of voting and execution of voting outcomes.

There will be a series of smart contracts that will be used to support the two main functions.

To support the **value transfer functions**, various smart contract applications will be used ranging from treasury smart contract (SC) of DAOs (based on the choice of standard DAO SCs), to Multisig wallets for the circles as well, as revenue division SCs for automated division of revenue streams amongst the various circles.

To support the **notary functions**, various voting smart contracts will be needed, where re-use of existing DAO SC is preferred. For the Bucket Voting System, a purpose built SC needs to be developed. For keeping track of decision ratios within circles, various tokens will be used. These tokens will be based as stated on industry standards like ERC-20.
