# Tech Setup

Finality around the technical setup of the G360DAO is not yet conclusive and is subject to various governance and roadmap design choices that need to be made. This chapter will be continuously updated accordingly.

The foundational principal for any technological choices regarding the setup is that we should re-use well-established industry standards as much as possible (e.g., ERC-20 and ERC-721 or equivalents hereof for tokens, based on the protocol the DAO will be deployed on, use only proven blockchain protocol like Ethereum, Avalanche, BSC, Gnosis Chain, etc. and if possible, re-use as many DAO Smart Contract Templates as possible, e.g., DAOHaus/Moloch or Aragon templates).&#x20;

Proprietary code should only be reserved for specific needs that support the DAO.
